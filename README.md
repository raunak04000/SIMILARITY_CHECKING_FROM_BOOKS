📚 Book Comparison Project

🎯 Overview

An elegant text analysis project that explores the fascinating relationships between 64 literary works. Using sophisticated comparison algorithms, this project uncovers hidden patterns and similarities in classic literature.

✨ Key Features

•	Identifies the 100 most influential words across the literary corpus
•	Generates a comprehensive 64x64 similarity matrix
•	Reveals the top 10 most closely related book pairs
•	Processes and analyzes raw text with precision
•	Implements robust comparison algorithms

📊 Results Highlight

Our analysis revealed some fascinating connections between books. Here are some notable findings:
1.	Gerard's Herbal volumes show remarkable similarity (91% match between Vol. 3 and Vol. 4)
2.	Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington demonstrates strong narrative consistency across volumes
3.	Foxes Book of Martyrs maintains thematic coherence throughout different parts

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Core Components

•	Custom Book class for efficient text representation
•	Advanced text preprocessing pipeline
•	Sophisticated similarity calculation algorithms
•	Comprehensive word frequency analysis

Technology Stack

•	Language: C++
•	Data Format: Raw text files
•	Analysis Method: Statistical text comparison

📈 Performance

The program efficiently processes 64 books and performs:
•	Word frequency analysis across entire corpus
•	2,016 unique book-to-book comparisons
•	Similarity ranking and sorting

🚀 Getting Started

1.	Clone the repository
2.	Ensure all book text files are in the designated directory
3.	Compile the C++ source files
4.	Run the executable
5.	Find results in the output directory
   
📝 Output Files

The program generates several output files:
•	common_words.txt: Top 100 most frequent words
•	similarity_matrix.txt: Complete comparison matrix
•	similar_books.txt: Top 10 most similar book pairs

🔍 Future Scope

•	Natural Language Processing integration
•	Interactive visualization dashboard
•	Semantic analysis capabilities
•	Genre classification features
•	Multi-language support

💡 Technical Note

The current implementation uses a single-threaded approach to ensure maximum stability and reliability. While this design choice impacts processing speed, it guarantees consistent results across all system configurations.
